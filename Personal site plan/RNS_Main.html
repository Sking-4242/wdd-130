        <h1>Do you ever wish you could knock down the classroom doors and learn from the great outdoors? Welcome to Rexburg Forest School! Every Saturday, children of all ages come together to explore, learn, and connect with nature in a hands-on, immersive way. With exciting field trips and adventures led by parents, children gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the world around them, all while making new friends and discovering their own passions. Join us for a few hours every Saturday dedicated to learning from nature.</h1>
