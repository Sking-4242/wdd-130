      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Week 08 - change this -->
        Where do we meet?
        We meet at a few different parks, trails, museums, and other places to learn more about the world around us.
        Is there a cost?
        Rexburg Nature School strives to be a cost-effective solution for parents trying to get out with their kids. We charge $10 a month per family to cover the cost of materials for various activities. 
        Is there a calendar? 
        We have a page on Facebook that announces all activities, what they are, and where they will be happening. You can find links to that on our Join Us page. In addition, we have an email list where you can receive information about the upcoming events.
        Who is invited?
        Everyone is invited to Nature School!
        Childcare
        We are NOT a childcare drop off. All children must have a parent or guardian present during Nature School.
        Are there different age groups?
        Yes! As the group grows more age groups will be added and as such activities will change and accommodate such growth.
